## General Information
- The dataset used here references a loan data that was taken from a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
- The data given in the dataset contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- In this case study, apart from applying the techniques learnt EDA, a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understanding of how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers is introduced.

## Conclusions

- whose 'loan amounts' are between 5000 to 10000.
- who have a 'term' of 36 months
- for the 'int_rate' between 10-14%
- who 'RENT' a home
- whose derogatory public records are 0
- total credit revolving balance is between 0-30
- whose issue year is 2011 and month is December

## Technologies Used
